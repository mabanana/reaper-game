This is a game prototype for a story based platformer. This prototype includes the base gameplay and a small level to explore.

You initially cannot interact with the word much, but as you progress you start to gain powers that allow you to traverse the world more freely and kill enemies.

The game ends when you have killed all the enemies and collected all the gems on the map.

## Story
You control a newbie reaper who has just started working for the reaper organization. You have a flying pal, and a boss to report to, and he will give you your task which is to kill frogs.
